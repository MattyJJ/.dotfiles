# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, i dont really like configuring stuff so i've done the minimum with no bs.
I don't recommend using these, they are very opinionated.

(Shitty fix)
to use languages managed under asdf i just did `Defaults !secure_path` in sudoers and alias sudo as sudo -E to keep current path
